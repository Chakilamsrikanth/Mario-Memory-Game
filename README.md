# Mario Memory Game

Fun and simple memory game, like the one from Super Mario 3, made with plain JavaScript.

## Instructions

To play, First display 12 unique cards, then duplicate them to have 24 cards in total. Randomize the display of these cards. When a card is selected, apply a distinct style to indicate it has been chosen. Ensure only two cards can be selected at a time. Check if the two selected cards match; if they do, hide them. After two cards have been selected, reset the guess count. Add a slight delay to the selection process for a smoother experience. Initially, show the back of each card and flip them to reveal the front when selected. The game is finished when all cards have been matched and hidden.
